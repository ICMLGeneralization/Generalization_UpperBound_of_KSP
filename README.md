# Out-of-Distribution Generalization Error Bounds for Successful Prediction of Autoregressive Algorithms
This is the demo of numerical calculation of the upper bound of K-run success probability between the In-distribution and the Bridge Distribution.
In this source, we provide a trained weight of PatchTST which can be run directly to validate the upper bound of KSP under ETTh (K=1, T=96).
